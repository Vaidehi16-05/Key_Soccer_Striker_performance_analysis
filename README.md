As a group of data analysts, we have been hired by the 'World Soccer' sports magazine.
Amid the thrilling matches of the FIFA World Cup, the management wants us to release a detailed report on Cristiano Ronaldo using data driven insights to attract and engage the audience

Our main objectives for this project:

    1. How has Manchester United's performance been over the last 20 years and how has Ronaldo been a huge contribution.
    
    2. Determine how playing matches on the home ground affected the winni-ng probability for Manchester Untited during the period where Ronaldo  played for them  vs the period he did not.
    
    We are interested in analysing how Ronaldo's performance boosted Manchester United's winning probability when was playing at the home ground. We will  be comparing the percentages between (2003-2009) and remaining seasons data for the club as a metric to add value.
    
    3. What does the trajectory of Ronaldo's career look like?
   
    4. Drilling down to one his best performances in a season i.e 2017/18  for Real Madrid, we try to analyse the pattern of how he scores goals.
